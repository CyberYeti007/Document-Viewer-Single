Other Commands

- psql -U postgres -d filemanager
	- sends you to sql command line interface for accessing the database

- psql -U postgres
  \c filemanager
	- does the same as above

- select * from "user"
	- necessary for reading user as user is a keyword of postgres and running the command without quotes will yield different results; all column names and table names with capital letters need quotes
